This file is the README for libpp 

Introduction
============

libpp.a is a library of objects that may be useful for doing particle
physics analysis.  It includes both three and four vectors, real and
complex matrices, a particle data table, particles, and events.

Installation
============

To build libpp.a you must have noweb installed on your machine.  Noweb
is a simple system for using literate programmings techniques.  It is
available from:
	http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/noweb/intro.html
and is fairly easy to install.

libpp now uses gnu configure to try and guess values for system dependancies.
To build the library, try:
	1) ./configure
	2) make
	3) make install

if you want to build for several platforms from the same source, make
a subdirectory where you want the objects to be built and execute
from there:

	1) ../configure
	2) make
	3) make install

The install step will place the library in /usr/local/lib and the header
files in /usr/local/include.  If you want these put in a different
place, use the --prefix option to configure to set $prefix to something
other than its default /usr/local. Or you could use the --libdir and
--includedir options to configure.  For example, a CLAS user may want
to use:

	1) ../configure --libdir=$CLAS_LIB --includedir=$CLAS_DEVEL/packages/inc_derived
	2) make
	3) make install

to build the documentation use:
    make dvi 

to get the latex source for the documentation use:
    make xxx.tex (where xxx is any name which corresponds to a xxx.nw file)
and then latex the produced file twice to get references correct.
or, to produce html documentation:
    make xxx.html
